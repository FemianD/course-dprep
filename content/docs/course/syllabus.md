## Course description

### Learning goals

The increasing complexity of data (e.g., scraped from the Internet)[^1] and analytics (e.g., requiring high-performance computing) require a novel way-of-working to efficiently manage empirical marketing research projects. Therefore, in this course, you (1) develop your coding skills in R ("code"), (2) collaborate on research projects using GitHub ("collaborate"), (3) automate your research pipeline end-to-end ("automate"). The three principles ("code-collaborate-automate") are applied along the typical research workflow (i.e., data exploration, preparation, analysis, and reporting), and particularly zoom in on engineering data sets from complex raw data, and disseminating research findings in a novel way (e.g., using apps).

[^1]: For example, see the data sections in these papers: [Building a user panel of music consumption from Spotify](http://tiu.nu/spotify), [Preparing a panel data set on electronics sales and marketing mix activities across thousands of brands](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/universality-or-differences-in-marketing-elasticities-in-emerging).

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Use R to
  - Explore data (stored in various formats) using RMarkdown, and clean and transform data for analysis (e.g., aggregation, merging, de-duplication, reshaping, date conversions, regular expressions)
  - Implement basic programming concepts to increase speed and minimize errors (e.g., looping, writing functions, handling errors/debugging)
  - Explore novel ways of disseminating research findings (e.g., apps)
- Use Git/GitHub to
  - Version code and collaborate on privately shared and public (open science) GitHub repositories
  - Professionalize your team collaboration (e.g., using GitHub Issues)
- Use Workflow Management Tools (`make`) to
  - Create and run portable, automated and reproducible data pipelines
  - Improve directory and file management in research projects

<!--- Document and archive final data sets, and learn how to make them available for public (re)use
- Professionalize your collaboration in teams using state-of-the-art frameworks (e.g., Scrum)
- Automate
  -
- Scale up
  - Familiarize yourself with cloud computing
  - Store and manage data using file-based systems and databases-->

### Positioning of the course in the study program

The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program. Seats are also offered to interested Research Master and PhD students. Learn more about enrollment [here](enroll).

This course zooms in on ways to handle data by means of analyzing and cleaning it. Furthermore, it introduces the version control system Git and the platform Github to work on projects and version code, as well as "make" to organize your projects and automate your workflow. For these reasons, students are recommended to follow this course before embarking on thesis projects.

## Prerequisites

- The course is instructed to MSc students in the Marketing Analytics (TiSEM) program.
- The course expects students to have acquired working knowledge in R (e.g., from introductory courses at Datacamp).
- The course welcomes novices, of whom __extra preparation prior to the start of the course is expected.__ Preparation material will be shared with students in advance in the form of R Notebooks or course recommendations at Datacamp. Novices may further benefit from following other courses at Tilburg University in which R is used.
- Students are recommended to use their own computer for this course (Windows, Mac or Linux). Android/Chromebook/iOS devices are not supported. Moreover, we highly recommend a computer with at least 8 GBs of RAM memory as we'll work with large data sets that require significant preprocessing.

## Teaching format

- Online-only (on Zoom)
- Combination of self-paced tutorials (e.g., using R Notebooks), and interactive live streams for feedback and coaching (recordings are shared with students)
- Learn state-of-the-art tools popular among scientists, marketing analysts and data scientists (e.g., R, GitHub)
- Open education & open science (all material is open; publicly accessible course page that stays with you, even after the end of the course)

<!--- Prepare for life-long learning (Open education (publicly accessible course page, copy-pasting code snippets and examples, starting projects with workflow templates)
- Life-long learning (course material will stay with you indefinitely
-->
<!--- Interactive, immersive and student-centred: live coding, working with real data sets <!--debates, -->
<!--, simulations, hackathon-->
<!-- work on VMs on AWS, code in SQL and R, compete on Kaggle, or work on own computer--; Coding Dojo student-=led analysis; while sharing screens-->

## Assessment

- Team project (4-5 team members) with self- and peer assessment (see below) (40%)
- Computer exam (60%)

Grades are made available on Canvas.

### Passing requirements

- Students pass this course if the final course grade (i.e., the weighted average of the group project and exam; weights indicated above) is ≥ 5.5, and the exam is passed (≥ 5.5).
- Final course grades are rounded to multiples of half points (e.g., 6, 6.5, 7, etc.).

### Resit policy

Students can fail this course in three situations:
- If students do not pass the exam, they cannot pass this course.
  - Required action: Students will have to take the [exam resit](exam).
- If students are not part of a team, they cannot obtain a grade for the team project, and hence cannot pass this course.
  - Required action: Re-enroll in this course's next edition, and ensure you are part of a team.
- If students pass the exam, but fail the team project (after SPA correction), their total course grade may be lower than 5.5, and hence students fail this course.
  - Required action: Correct team project on the basis of the course coordinator's grading report, and hand it in again within 2 weeks after publication of the final grades in this course (submission on Canvas). __Only students who fail this course are eligible to have their team projects re-graded.__

## Code of Conduct

- When meeting on Zoom, please turn on your camera, which will facilitate interaction with the course instructor and other students.
- Please always use English as the default language so that non-Dutch speakers can follow the conversations, even if it concerns topics not directly related to the class (e.g., during breaks).
- Please head over the course's [support section](support) to solve problems or get in touch with the instructor.
- Stay up-to-date, by checking this website, Canvas, and watch out for [updates/polls on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannes-datta/) and videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/hannesdatta).
- Be on time, and start on time.
- Feel invited to always provide informal feedback!
- It's totally fine calling the instructor by his first name. Also add your instructor

__We value diversity and inclusion__

In this course, we do our best to embrace diversity and stimulate integration. We encourage students to be proud of their background (e.g., ethnicity, nationality), their personal interest (e.g., hobbies), or any other thing that characterizes them. Two ways for students to bring in *their perspective* is choosing (a) with whom to collaborate (e.g., purposefully bring in people of diverse backgrounds or technical skill levels to a team), and (b) which topic to work on in the team project (e.g., spending sufficient time getting to know each other, creating a safe space, and being open to work on topics off the main stream).

Please feel invited to talk to the course coordinator at any point in time!

### Structure of the course

Please head over to the course's [modules](../modules) and check out the [weekly schedule](schedule).

<!--
- their individual contribution to the overall team effort (measured by means of scoring themselves and their team members on, among others, the quantity and quality of their contributions), and
- students' individual investment in developing the technical skills required to contribute meaningfully to the project (measured by means of students' individual submissions of answers to the tutorials/data challenges).

-->



<!--
{{< hint info >}}
__Calculation of individual grades from team grades__

1. Students score themselves and other team members on the following questions (answered on a scale between 1 = lowest, and 5 = highest)
  - How was the pro-active attitude of the student?
  - How was the student as a team player?
  - How was the quantity of the contribution (e.g., time, energy) of the student?
  - How was the quality of the contribution of the student?
  - How was the quality of feedback to team members given by the student?

2. Compute average score from (1) for each student within a team, across all questions. ("How did team members rate the focal student?")

3. Compute average team effort score, by averaging (within each team) the scores obtained in (2). ("What was the overall team effort?")

4. Compute students' self- and peer assessment score (`SPAscore`), by dividing each student's score by the team average. ("How did the student perform, relative to the overall team effort?"

5. Multiply the `SPAscore` by 1.05 if the focal student has provided proof of skill investment (at least three submissions on Canvas).

6. Correct team grades using the following formula:

      {{< katex display >}}
      finalgrade = w * teamgrade + (1-w) * SPAscore * teamgrade
      {{< /katex >}}

  where w is set to .8, weighting individual performance against a team's overall performance.

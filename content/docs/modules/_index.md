# Modules

The course consists of weekly modules covering the three principles of the *new way of working* (i.e., code, collaborate, automate). In the team assignment, students apply these principles on each stage of an empirical research project.

<!--The first five weeks (including one self-study week) equip you with the skills to work on data-intensive research projects efficiently.

The remaining three weeks are dedicated to working on a team project, in which you put your skills into practice.

# Preparation before the course starts

This course requires an advanced software setup before you can get started. So, please spend some time carefully working through the software installation guide!

- [Install software (R & RStudio, Git, automation & build tools) now](../../../docs/tutorials/software-installation/_index.md)

We also use some premium content of Datacamp.com, so make sure to sign up using your Tilburg University account to be able to follow the material.

- Get a [Datacamp.com account to access Premium content for free](../../../docs/course/support/datacamp)

Finally, we recommend using a text editor, as this greatly improves your user experience and allows you to easily change text and code. In combination with Hugo, you can see a preview of the changes that you made to a site instantly!

- [Click here to install Atom as your text editor](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/text-editor/)

# Tutorial: Exploring and auditing data with RMarkdown

## Learning goals

- Setup R and R Studio
- Explore data sets in R
  - Read data from text files into data frames in R
  - Create and handle various data types in R (e.g., vector, matrix, dataframe)
  - Change the content of data frames (e.g., create, drop, or rename columns)
  - Filter data in data frames (e.g., by index, logical expressions, missing records, etc.)
  - Apply basic programming concepts (if-else statements, for-loop, functions )
- Assess data quality and obtain an understanding about the data
  - Calculate with data (e.g., taking an average)
  - Generate summary statistics (e.g., using `summary()` and `table()`)
  - Generate plots (e.g., using `plot()`)
  - Produce an RMarkdown document (HTML, PDF)

<!--* Analyze data (summary statistics, mathematical operations, sort data, plots)-->

## Planning

- Please plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting started

1. Develop your R skills by completing the course [Intermediate R on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) (about 4-6 hours)
2. Practice by exploring a new dataset with R and RMarkdown ([View](intro-to-r.html), [Download; right click - download file as](intro-to-r.Rmd))

<!--- If you like, you can submit your exercises as a "proof for investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment). Work on the exercises in the answer skeleton file ([Download](intro-to-r-skeleton.Rmd); right-click, download linked file as...). Then, open the file in RStudio.


### Create (Data Challenge #1)
- Create an RMarkdown report in which you explore open-ended questions! Start from the answer skeleton ([View](data-report.html), [Download; right click - download file as](data-report.Rmd))
- If you like, you can submit your data challenge as a "proof for investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment).

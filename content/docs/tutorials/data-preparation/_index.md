# Tutorial: Engineering data sets


## Learning goals

* Merge data sets on one or more indices and understand the different types of joins (inner, left, right join)
* Handle and preprocess string data (remove characters, splitting)
* Apply a variety of feature engineering techniques (grouping, rank, counter)
* Document code and analyses with an R Markdown


## Planning

- Please plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting started

1. Develop your R skills by completing the DataCamp courses
    - [DataCamp Introduction to Tidyverse](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse/data-wrangling-1?ex=1) (chapter 1 and 3),
    - [DataCamp Cleaning Data in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-r) (chapter 1 and 2), and
    - [DataCamp Joining Data with dplyr](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-dplyr/joining-tables-1) (chapter 1 and 2).

2. Practice some more by preparing a dataset with R for further analysis ([View](data-preparation.html), [Download; right click - download file as](data-preparation.Rmd))
    - Download the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiPmhClawJRSfGEaMKmIX3o2nk7dInUN/view?usp=sharing) and store it in the same directory as your Markdown file.

<!--
### Create (Data Challenge #2)
- Create an RMarkdown report in which you explore open-ended questions! Start from the answer skeleton ([View](data-report.html), [Download; right click - download file as](data-report.Rmd))

If you like, you can submit your exercises and/or data challenge as a "proof of investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment).

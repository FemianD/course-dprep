# Tutorial: Project Management and Version Control with Git/GitHub

## Learning goals

* Setup Git and GitHub, and know what both are
* Experience the power of file versioning (e.g., restoring, branching) from the command line/terminal
* Apply the end-to-end Git workflow, using simple text files created in the editor
* Learn to collaborate on projects using GitHub

## Planning

* Please plan about one day to work through this tutorial.

## Getting Started

1. Develop your command line (Windows) / terminal (Mac) skills
    - Follow the [DataCamp Introduction to Shell](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell) (chapter 1).
    - We recommend Mac users to [also take a look at this tutorial](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl) (optional).

2. Learn to use Git
    - To get an understanding of what issues, pull requests and commits are and how these work, follow [this short introduction](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) on Github.  
    - Get started with applying the end-to-end Git workflow using Git Bash (i.e., through the command line) ([View tutorial](version-control.html))
    - Curious how to use Git with a graphical user interface? (optional, but highly useful)
      - [Sourcetreeapp](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) is a free Git client for Windows, Mac and Linux!
      - Git also [smoothly integrates with R - find out how!](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/)

3. Put your skills into practice by following [the exercises on this week's module!](docs/modules/week2)
